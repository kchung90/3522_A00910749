## How my application works

When the application is run, the system displays the menu on the 
screen. User can either register himself to the program, or select an 
option to load a test user to test the program. When user selects the 
menu to register himself, the user must input all the required 
information including personal information, bank account information, 
and the budget information. After the user is registered, user can view 
the budget, record transaction, view all transactions made up to date 
by each budget category, or view bank account details by selecting the 
menu options.
     
## Limitations
 
 User must input correct data type for each input. For instance, a user 
 must make sure that the input for bank balance is a number. If a user 
 tries to input a String in the bank balance, the system will display 
 an error message. Information about the data types for each input can 
 be found in the documentation.
    
## Features

- Register User: This menu allows the user to register himself to the
 program by typing in the correct information.
- Load Test User: This menu loads the test user that is already 
registered in the system for a testing purpose. A test user is a Rebel 
type user.
- View Budgets: This menu displays the details of the user's budget for 
each category including the total amount of budget allocated, amount of 
budget spent, amount of budget remaining, and the status of the budget.
- Record Transaction: This menu allows the user to record the 
transaction. Once the user inputs details of the transaction, the 
system will decide whether the transactions can be processed or not 
depending on the status of the bank account and the budget. If the 
transaction is processed, the transaction is recorded in the system.
- View Transaction By Budget: This menu allows the user can view all 
the transactions recorded up to date for each budget.
- View Bank Account Details: This menu allows the user to view all the
 details about the user's bank account and the transactions recorded up 
 to date.
